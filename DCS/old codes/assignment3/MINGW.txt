Type Developer Command Prompt in the search bar.

You should see an app named "Developer Command Prompt for VS <version>". Click on it to open it.

This new window will look similar to a standard command prompt, but it will have a specific prompt like C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\<version>\...\>. This indicates that the environment is correctly configured.

Now, in this new window, navigate to your desktop:cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\MPI
cl.exe add.c /I"C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/MPI/Include" /link /LIBPATH:"C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/MPI/Lib/x86" msmpi.lib
Final Step: Run the Program
Now that you have the add.exe executable, you can run it using the mpiexec command. This command is the MPI process launcher that will start your program on multiple processes.

Run the following command in the same C:\Users\HP-PC\Desktop\MPI> command prompt:mpiexec -n 2 add.exe
